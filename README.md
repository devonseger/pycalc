# ðŸ“Œ Python Recursive Calculator

This is a simple **recursive calculator** written in Python. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and decide whether to continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.

## ðŸ“œ Features
- Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Uses **recursion** to continue calculations.
- Prevents **division by zero**.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. Enter the second number.
5. The program will display the result.
6. You can choose:
   - Press `y` to **continue calculating** with the result.
   - Press `n` to **start a new calculation**.

## ðŸ”§ Example Usage
```
Please enter the first number: 10
Pick an operation: *
Please enter the second number: 5
Result: 10 * 5 = 50
Press 'y' to continue calculating with 50, or press 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: -
Please enter the second number: 20
Result: 50 - 20 = 30
Press 'y' to continue calculating with 30, or press 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```
